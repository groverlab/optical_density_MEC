Usage
-----

This program expects to be run in the same directory as the folder named
"yeast data from optical density MEC" containing binary data from the optical
density MEC.  When this program is run, it reads in this raw data, filters it
using a median filter, and shows a plot of voltage vs. time.

Dependencies
------------

- Python 2.X (http://www.python.org)
- Numpy (http://www.numpy.org)
- Scipy (http://www.scipy.org)
- Matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org)
